        <h2>Career Summary</h2>
        <p>A super fun freeride trail starting with the Pinkbike drop, an impressive 12' by 12' drop followed non stop features with lots of speed and perfect flow. As the valley begins to close, the route transitions to a section of open forest. By the end of the 45-50 miles you'll be plenty tired from the constant up and down nature of Mana Road. Be warned, this is not for the faint of heart! An awesome descent, with some high speed ripping at the top, some root drops in the middle, and some great bank turns at the bottom.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the lake-side trail has a hike-a-bike section in the middle. Wait a few days after any fresh snowfall and the entire area becomes one giant freeride trail after all the shredders pack down the powder. Rowdy little downhill/freeride track. The area is mostly wooded but there are several places that offer spectacular views. While it has no real technical features to speak of since being redesigned, it is a lot of fun to ride this glassy smooth and generally well-bermed trail.</p>
            
        <p>The trails have a decidedly old school vibe with lots of rocks, roots, tight turns and steep pitches and are sure to keep even the most experienced riders on their toes. 3. From the young (or not so young) beginner, to the downhill pro, a flow trail delivers smiles for riders of all ages and skill level. At the bottom the trail joins Hide and Seek above a major creek crossing. You can find everyone out here having fun from people in body armor and downhill bikes to families testing their kids limits to xc racer types riding intervals.</p>
